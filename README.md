I am Souhail AIT LAHCEN, student at ESILV Paris, La Défense.

I am passionate about robotic and informatics also study blockchain and crypto-markets in FinTech at ESILV. Now, I’m in two student associations, DaVinciBot (association of robotic) and LéoFive (association of futsal).

I began to learn robotic because I think, nowadays, represent the future and I wanted to improve and increase my hard skills (especially in the computing and electronics field). I participated in the French robotic cup in 2019 (even if in the last minutes the competition was cancelled) then in last year I became the vice-president of this association and now as you understood I am the co-president. If you want to learn much about me, you can go on my LinkedIn.
